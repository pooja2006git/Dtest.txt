# Dtest.txt #Training and Testing dataset
The goal is to train a machine learning model to recognize handwritten text in answer sheets. This involves using deep learning algorithms and neural networks for accurate detection and classification. Currently, the model's accuracy and capability to detect characters and digits have been tested using the MNIST dataset(Dtest.py).
